## GPS

Google Maps API is used to integrate GPS functionality into the self-driving car system. The API provides the system with access to Google Maps data, including maps, routes, and real-time traffic information.

The GPS data obtained through the Google Maps API is used by the decision-making node to determine the best route to the vehicle's destination and to adjust the vehicle's driving behavior in real-time based on current traffic conditions.

It should be noted that the Google Maps API is a third-party tool that is used to enhance the functionality of the self-driving car system.
