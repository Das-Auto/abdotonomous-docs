## GPS

Abdotonomous employs the Google Maps API (non-free) to determine the global location of your vehicle. This feature is especially useful for autonomous vehicles that need to navigate to specific destinations or operate in large areas where precise location data is critical. To utilize the GPS feature, simply enable it in the Abdotonomous system and let the system do the rest.
